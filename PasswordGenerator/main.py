Description:
  A simple Password Generator with a lot of potential that can generate passwords with great length that can be personilized with the use lower-case letters as well as upper-case letters, numbers and especial symbols.
  The code was made as part of the course: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
